         <details>
            <summary><span>Q.</span> What is the best time to travel to India?</summary>
            <p>The diverse topography of India comprises mountains, beaches, and deserts. The large size of the country
               also blesses it with different climatic conditions, which means that, while some places in India may have
               the mercury rising in the summers, there are some, where the weather is cool and pleasant. Therefore, the
               best time to travel to India depends on the places a tourist would like to visit in the country. However,
               it
               is also safe to say that the winter season (October - March) is mostly preferred by the tourists while
               visiting India.</p>
            <p>For wildlife sightings, both summer (March-mid June) and winter seasons are favourable. While the winter
               season is best for sighting animals basking in the sun during the day time, summer is the time when they
               can
               be seen frequently paying a visit to the water holes.</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary><span>Q.</span> What kind of clothes do I need to carry while traveling to India ?</summary>
            <p><b>Two things to keep in mind while packing for India are:</b></p>
            <p><b>1. Season :</b> Since India experiences hot summers (in most of the parts) and chilly winters,
               travellers
               should pack according to the month they are planning a visit in. If the trip is planned in the months
               between March and September, carrying light woolens (in the hills) and cotton clothes (in other areas)
               will
               be enough. On the other hand, if the trip is scheduled between October and February, carrying heavy
               woollens
               for North India and light woollens for South India is advisable.</p>
            <p><b>2. Special Interest Tour :</b> If you have booked your tour for trekking in India or wildlife safari
               or
               any other specific activity, then the clothing has to be carried accordingly. For wildlife safari,
               camouflage clothing, or clothes of green and brown shades are recommended. For trekking, clothing varies
               according to the place, altitude, season and difficulty grade. Though carrying clothes for layering; a
               down
               jacket; a good pair or trekking shoes; a sun hat; a woollen cap, muffler; socks; and a pair of gloves are
               required.</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary><span>Q.</span> Is India a safe place to travel with kids?</summary>
            <p>Yes, it is safe to travel to India with kids. While you can travel with kids almost anywhere in the
               country,
               there are some places that make for better family travel destinations, with their good hotels, plenty of
               activities for kids, clean air and safer environs.</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary><span>Q.</span> Is payment through credit card accepted in India widely?</summary>
            <p>Yes, in all major cities and towns in India, credit card payments are accepted in hotels, restaurants,
               and
               shops. Visa and Master Cards are widely accepted around the country, while some places also accept
               American
               Express, besides other types of cards.</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary><span>Q.</span> I don't know English, how to deal with it while traveling to India?</summary>
            <p>While English is spoken and understood by a large number of people in India, it isnâ€™t an absolute
               necessity.
               Instead, focus on learning some Hindi words that come in use in daily lives. You can also book a tour
               with
               Tour My India that offers tour guides who are proficient in different languages and can be mediators
               between
               you and other people you encounter in the country.</p>

            <p>Yes, the internet is easily available in India. All the major cities and towns, hotels, restaurants, and
               cafes in the popular destinations in India offer free Wi-Fi to their guests.</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary><span>Q.</span> Do I need to take any medical precautions before going on a tour to India?
            </summary>
            <p>The CDC and WHO recommend the following vaccinations for India: Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid,
               cholera,
               yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, meningitis, polio, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), Tdap
               (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis), chickenpox, shingles, pneumonia and influenza.</p>
            <p>While most of the vaccines mentioned are optional and depend upon the country you are visiting from and
               your
               personal health status, it is recommended to get Hepatitis A and typhoid vaccinations along with Cholera,
               Hepatitis B, Japanese Encephalitis, Rabies, and Yellow Fever as precaution.</p>
